I noticed that this problem only happened when I rapidly reloaded the two canvas elements with png data from different sources. I don't think the png files were corrupted because the issue was not consistent and it affected different images each time. However, when I changed my code to reuse the same canvas element for both sources, the problem disappeared and everything worked fine.
