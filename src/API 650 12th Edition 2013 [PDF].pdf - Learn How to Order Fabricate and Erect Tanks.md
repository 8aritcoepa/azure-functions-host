Why is API 650 important for oil storage tanks?
 
Oil storage tanks are essential for the oil and gas industry, as they store the crude oil or refined products that are produced or imported. Oil storage tanks also provide operational flexibility, as they allow for inventory management, blending, and transportation. However, oil storage tanks also pose significant risks, such as fire, explosion, leakage, and environmental damage. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that oil storage tanks are designed, fabricated, erected, and tested according to the highest standards of safety and quality.
