- Make sure your Windows 7 64-bit is up to date with the latest service pack and security updates. You can check for updates by going to Start > Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Update.
- Make sure your graphics card is not overheating or damaged. You can monitor the temperature and fan speed of your graphics card by using a tool like GPU-Z or MSI Afterburner. If the temperature is too high or the fan is not working properly, you may need to clean the dust from your graphics card or replace the thermal paste or fan.
- Make sure your power supply unit (PSU) is sufficient and stable for your graphics card. You can check the wattage and voltage of your PSU by using a tool like HWMonitor or CPUID PowerMax. If the wattage is too low or the voltage is too unstable, you may need to upgrade your PSU or use a different power outlet.
- Make sure your graphics card is compatible with your motherboard and BIOS. You can check the compatibility by visiting the manufacturer's website of your graphics card and motherboard. If there is a BIOS update available for your motherboard, you may need to download and install it.
- Make sure you have uninstalled any previous drivers or software related to your graphics card before installing the new driver. You can use the AMD Cleanup Utility to remove any leftover files or registry entries from your system.
- If none of the above tips work, you can try to reinstall the driver in safe mode or use the AMD Driver Auto-detect Tool to find the best driver for your system.
