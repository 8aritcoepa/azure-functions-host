## Why Use TomTom Maps?
 
TomTom is one of the leading providers of digital maps and navigation services in the world. TomTom maps cover more than 200 countries and territories with high-quality and up-to-date data. TomTom maps offer many advantages over free OSM maps, such as:
 
- Better road coverage and accuracy
- More detailed and updated points of interest (POI)
- Speed limits and camera warnings
- Lane guidance and junction views
- Truck-specific attributes and restrictions
- Alternative routes and live traffic information

However, TomTom maps are not free and require a subscription or a one-time purchase to use them with MapFactor Navigator. The price of TomTom maps varies depending on the region and the device. For example, a one-year subscription for Europe costs $29.99 for Android devices and $39.99 for iOS devices.
