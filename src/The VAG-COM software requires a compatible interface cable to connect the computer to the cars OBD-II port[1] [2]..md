## What's New in AutoCAD 2012?
 
AutoCAD 2012 is not only a powerful design software, but also a versatile one. It has many new features and enhancements that can help you work faster, smarter, and easier. Here are some of the highlights:

- **Autodesk Content Explorer**: This is a new tool that allows you to search and access your local and network content quickly and easily. You can find blocks, layers, styles, xrefs, and more within your drawings or folders. You can also preview and insert the content directly from the Content Explorer window[^1^] [^2^].
- **AutoCAD WS Integration**: AutoCAD 2012 provides seamless integration with AutoCAD WS, a free web and mobile application that lets you view, edit, and share your drawings online. You can upload your drawings to the cloud, access them from any device, and collaborate with your partners in real time[^1^].
- **Associative Array**: The array command has been improved to create associative arrays that can be edited easily. You can create rectangular, polar, or path arrays that maintain a relationship with the original objects. You can also modify the array properties such as number, spacing, angle, and alignment[^1^].
- **Multi-Functional Grips**: The grips of objects have been enhanced to provide more options and flexibility. You can use the grips to stretch, move, rotate, scale, copy, or mirror objects without switching tools. You can also use dynamic input and dimensions to enter precise values[^1^].
- **Autodesk Inventor Fusion**: This is a new application that comes with AutoCAD 2012. It allows you to create and edit 3D models using direct and parametric modeling techniques. You can import 3D models from AutoCAD or other applications, modify them in Fusion, and export them back to AutoCAD[^1^].
- **Model Documentation**: This is a new feature that enables you to create 2D drawing views from 3D models. You can create base, projected, section, and detail views that are automatically updated when the model changes. You can also import 3D models from Autodesk Inventor and create drawing views from them[^1^].
- **AutoComplete Command Entry**: This is a new feature that helps you enter commands faster and easier. As you type a command or alias, AutoCAD displays a list of possible matches. You can select the desired command from the list or press Tab to cycle through them[^1^].
- **System Requirements**: AutoCAD 2012 requires a minimum of Windows XP SP3 or Windows 7 operating system, Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon processor, 2 GB of RAM, 2 GB of free disk space, and 1024 x 768 display resolution. For 3D modeling, it requires a higher processor speed, more RAM, and a compatible graphics card[^3^].

These are some of the new features and enhancements in AutoCAD 2012. To learn more about them and how to use them effectively, you can refer to the help documentation or online resources.
