- Powerful sound engine modulation: Spire allows you to create rich and complex sounds using its four multimode oscillators, each with nine waveforms (Classic, Noise, FM, AMSync, SawPWM, HardFM, Vowel, Reso and Harmonics), two multimode filters (each with five types: Perfecto, Infecto, Acido, Scorpio and Combo), four envelopes (each with ADSR or ADBD modes), four LFOs (each with six waveforms), a step sequencer (with up to 16 steps) and an arpeggiator (with 10 modes). You can also use the modulation matrix to assign any of these parameters to any other parameter or external MIDI controller.
- Flexible architecture: Spire allows you to customize your sound using its four polyphonic unison modes (each with nine voices), two global effects slots (each with nine effects: Shaper/Decimator, Phaser/Vowel, Chorus/Flanger, Delay, Reverb, EQ, Compressor, Multiband Compressor and Limiter), two master effects slots (each with three effects: EQ, Compressor and Limiter) and a master volume control. You can also use the global settings to adjust the polyphony mode (up to 32 voices), the oversampling mode (up to 8x), the quality mode (Eco or HQ) and the MIDI settings.
- Graphical interface that provides unparalleled usability: Spire has a user-friendly and intuitive interface that makes it easy to navigate and edit your sounds. You can use the preset browser to browse and load more than 900 factory presets or your own custom presets. You can also use the bank manager to organize your presets into banks and categories.
