## Features and Presets of Khords
 
Khords is divided into two main sections: the sample selector and the synth engine. The sample selector lets you choose from 315 chord and note samples, which are organised into three categories: major, minor and root/open. Each category has subcategories based on the instrument type, such as guitar, piano, synth, etc. You can browse through the samples using the arrows or the drop-down menu, or you can use the random button to get a random sample within the same category.
 
The synth engine lets you modify the sound of the selected sample using various parameters and effects. You can adjust the volume, pan, pitch and formant of the sample using the knobs on the top left. You can also use the warp mode to change the timing of the sample, making it faster or slower. The warp mode has three options: sync, free and off. Sync mode syncs the sample to the host tempo and lets you choose from different note values. Free mode lets you adjust the speed of the sample manually using a slider. Off mode plays the sample at its original speed.
 
Below the warp mode, you can find the filter section, which lets you apply one of 12 filter types to the sample. You can choose from low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch and various combinations of them. You can also adjust the pre-drive, resonance and key tracking of the filter using the knobs. The filter also has an ADSR envelope and an LFO that can modulate its cutoff frequency. You can set the amount, rate, shape, phase and trigger mode of the LFO using the sliders and buttons.
