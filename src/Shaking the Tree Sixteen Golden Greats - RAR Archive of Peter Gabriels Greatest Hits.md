Another highlight of the album is "Sledgehammer", the lead single from Gabriel's fifth album So. It is a fun and funky song that showcases Gabriel's sense of humor and his love for soul music. The song features a horn section, a synthesizer bass line, and backing vocals by female singers. The song was accompanied by a groundbreaking music video that used stop-motion animation and claymation, winning nine MTV Video Music Awards in 1987. The song was Gabriel's biggest hit in the US, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
 
The album also includes "Don't Give Up", a beautiful and moving duet with Kate Bush. The song is a message of hope and encouragement to someone who is facing hard times. The song was inspired by the photographs of Dorothea Lange, who documented the effects of the Great Depression in America. The song features a simple piano melody and a contrasting vocal arrangement, with Gabriel singing the verses and Bush singing the chorus. The song was a hit in several countries, especially in the UK where it reached number nine on the singles chart.

Another song that showcases Gabriel's talent for world music is "Shaking The Tree", the title track of the album. The song is a collaboration with Youssou N'Dour, one of the most famous singers from Senegal. The song is a celebration of women's empowerment and a call for social change. The song features a blend of African and Western instruments, such as drums, guitars, keyboards, and kora. The song also features a chorus of female singers from different countries, singing in different languages. The song was released as a single in 1990 and became a hit in several European countries.
 
The album closes with "Here Comes the Flood", one of Gabriel's earliest solo songs. It is a haunting and powerful song that deals with the theme of apocalypse and rebirth. The song features only Gabriel's voice and a piano, creating a stark contrast with the rest of the album. The song was originally recorded for his first album in 1977, but Gabriel was unhappy with the production and preferred to perform it live with a simpler arrangement. The version on the album is a live recording from 1979, capturing the raw emotion and intensity of the song.
 
Shaking The Tree - Sixteen Golden Greats is more than just a collection of songs. It is a journey through Gabriel's musical evolution and his artistic expression. It is a reflection of his diverse influences and his unique voice. It is a tribute to his fans and his collaborators. It is an album that deserves to be listened to and appreciated by anyone who loves music.
